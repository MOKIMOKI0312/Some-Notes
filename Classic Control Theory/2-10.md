## 3. Time and Frequency Domain Analysis
- time domain: 
For a general solution, $X(t) = A sin(\omega t + \phi)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase angle.
usually, we ignore the phase angle, and only consider the amplitude and frequency.

- Fourier series:
$$
X(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} A_n sin(n\omega t + \phi_n)$$
where $A_n$ is the amplitude of the nth harmonic, and $\phi_n$ is the phase angle of the nth harmonic.
- Each sinusoid must be a multipule of the lowest frequency, usually called the 1st harmonic.(第一谐波)

Example:
$$
m \ddot{x} + c \dot{x} + kx = 0
$$
$$
x(t) = e^{-\alpha t} (A \sin(\omega t + \phi))$$

laplace transform:

$$
\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\sigma t} e^{-j\omega t} dt = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-(\sigma + j\omega) t} dt = \frac{1}{\sigma + j\omega}
$$

## 4. LTI Systems
- LTI systems are systems that are both linear(additivility) and time-invariant.

## 6. Fourier Transform(1)
- Fourier transform
$$
F(\nu) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-2\pi i \nu t} dt
$$
- Inverse Fourier transform
$$
f(t) =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\nu) e^{2\pi j\nu t} d\nu
$$
> $\frac{\omega}{2\pi}=\nu    $ is the frequency in Hz
- all sinusoids can in turn be completely described by their amplitude, frenquency, and phase angle
